            <p>Hello, My name is Elizabeth </p>
            <p>Meet Elizabetth, the heart and hands behind our bakery. A proud native Spanish speaker from Guanajuato, Mexico, Elizabetth migrated years ago in search of new opportunities. After working tirelessly across multiple jobs, she made the courageous decision to follow her true passionâ€”baking. With love in every recipe, she now crafts delicious cakes, cookies, and desserts inspired by her roots and made with the dedication only a mother can give. Below is her first ever product! Feel free to look around and checkout out the menu!</p>
