        <p>Hello, my name is Elizabeth.</p>
        <p>
          I'm the heart and hands behind this bakery. A proud native Spanish speaker from Guanajuato, Mexico, I migrated years ago in search of new opportunities. After working tirelessly across multiple jobs, I made the courageous decision to follow my true passionâ€”baking. With love in every recipe, I now craft delicious cakes, cookies, and desserts inspired by my roots and made with the dedication only a mother can give.
